BUG : 1 blue ghost move when pausing for the win
	was blinking
	moving
take2
	red ghost

Rename PauseModule to Timer or something...



Call Pellet / PowerUp collision in PlayingState instead of Player
	Waka sound handled in PlayingState?


Move IsWarning() from FleeingState to better explain the States purpose. maybe "FleeingRoamingMovement".
	Maybe should make FleeingState NOT an IState? so it's not confusing why you don't switch to it.
BUG?
	AmbushState (and probably ChaseState) does not update target after Fleeing. This is because Enter() is not called since it never actually switches...
	Make RoamingState into a weak pointer, and switch between PersonalityState and FleeingState ..?
		SwitchRoamingState();


Maybe do EntityPosition and ScreenPosition for conversions?
EntityPosition : public Vect2 {
	ScreenPosition ToScreenPosition();
} // and vice versa

	Collider
		ScreenPosition* m_pos
	GameObjectData
		EntityPosition m_pos;
	Tile(EntityPosition p_pos)
		




	RESTRUCTURE

make sure all pointers follow the "wPtr" naming convention. Even SoundClip and Sprites
	OR replace all "wPtr" with "" :]

GameObject -> Entity

IMoveable
	MovementModule*
	Level*

IDrawable
	make GameObject a Drawable

	Remove Draw function from IState, or give it : public Drawable




polish:
	faster pathfinding
