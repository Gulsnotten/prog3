fix pos change in win animation



title screen mumbo



BUG : 1 blue ghost move when pausing for the win
	was blinking
	moving
take2
	red ghost

Rename PauseModule to Timer or something...




Maybe do EntityPosition and ScreenPosition for conversions?
EntityPosition : public Vect2 {
	ScreenPosition ToScreenPosition();
} // and vice versa

	Collider
		ScreenPosition* m_pos
	GameObjectData
		EntityPosition m_pos;
	Tile(EntityPosition p_pos)
		




	RESTRUCTURE

make sure all pointers follow the "wPtr" naming convention. Even SoundClip and Sprites
	OR replace all "wPtr" with "" :]

GameObject -> Entity

IMoveable
	MovementModule*
	Level*

IDrawable
	make GameObject a Drawable

	Remove Draw function from IState, or give it : public Drawable




polish:
	faster pathfinding
