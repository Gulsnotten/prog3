	FONT

For this game I wanted a custom font, so heres what I did:
	* load a .txt-file with all the characters from the font texture, in the same order
	* chop the texture into sprites of the independent characters, and put it in a map with the corresponding char from the .txt-file as the key.
When printing a string I can just access each char of the string through the map



	Changes to Collision

Made Player and the Ghosts always use a Collider to check collisions, except for eating pellets (which are not ICollideable). For the hitboxes to feel fair, the ghosts standard Collider is just a point in the middle of the 
sprite. when the Ghost turns blue, his Collider expands to Pacmans size.



	HUD

Now prints
	* extra lives
	* score



	Ghost score visualization

You pass an Animation* in Flee() now, which the ghost switches to. Since the ghost is not updated during the pause, the ghost will keep this Animation until the pause ends.
