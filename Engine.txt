// doot doot nice info

do not forward declare in .cpp (?)

never put standard values in .h files, it just declares the interface. it doesn't actually set the values for new objects

forward declaration works for pointers and references, when we dont need the functionality

patterns
	wrapper
	adapter
	facad


way of working:
	starting at the base, the highest starting point

	declaring uses and expectations of interfaces

	providing definitions for classes -> subclasses
